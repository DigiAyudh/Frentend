## Authentication

The system supports three user roles:

1. **Admin**: Full system access, employee management, certificate issuance, compliance tracking
2. **Employee**: Personal dashboard, project access, task management, document uploads
3. **Client**: Project visibility, task tracking, document downloads, invoice access

Session tokens are stored in localStorage with automatic cleanup on logout.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_APP_NAME=DigiAyudh
```

## User Sessions

User sessions are automatically restored on page refresh through the `AuthInitializer` component:
- Checks for stored authentication token on app load
- Fetches current user data if token exists
- Maintains session across browser sessions
- Automatically redirects based on user role

## Navigation Updates

The public navbar now displays:
- **Logged Out**: "Get Started" button linking to login
- **Logged In**: User name and "Dashboard" button routing to role-specific dashboard
- **Logout Option**: One-click logout with session cleanup

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Pages
1. Create page in `src/pages/{role}/{PageName}.tsx`
2. Add route in `src/App.tsx`
3. Use `PrivateRoute` for protected pages
4. Implement role-based access if needed

### Creating Components
1. Place in `src/components/{category}/{ComponentName}.tsx`
2. Export from index file if reusable
3. Use TypeScript for type safety
4. Follow shadcn/ui component patterns for UI elements

### State Management
1. Create Redux slice in `src/redux/slices/{domain}Slice.ts`
2. Define interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`
3. Use hooks from `redux/hooks.ts` for dispatch and selectors
4. Implement async thunks for API calls

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of route components
- Code splitting by dashboard role
- Optimized bundle with Vite
- React Fast Refresh for development
- Tailwind CSS purging for production

## Security Considerations

- Session tokens cleared on logout
- Role-based access control enforced at route level
- Token stored in localStorage (consider httpOnly cookies for enhanced security)
- Public certificate verification endpoints require no authentication
- Authorization checks on all CRUD operations

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Commit changes: `git commit -am 'Add your feature'`
3. Push to branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
